          title: "⚠️ Integration Broken: Kadermanager Website Changed?"
          body: |
            The weekly check of the Kadermanager integration has failed.

            This typically means the **kadermanager.de** website structure has changed, and the HTML classes used for scraping are no longer valid.

            Please investigate `scripts/check_live.py` failures or run it locally to diagnose.

            **Error Log:**
            See usages in the Actions tab.
